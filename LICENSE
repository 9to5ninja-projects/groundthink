## Disclaimer

THIS SOFTWARE IS EXPERIMENTAL RESEARCH CODE.

- This is an experimental hybrid architecture (Mamba2 + RWKV6) under active development
- The model has NOT been validated for production use
- Training may produce unexpected results, including but not limited to:
  - Model collapse
  - NaN/Inf values
  - Memory exhaustion
  - Incorrect outputs
- No guarantees are made about model behavior, safety, or correctness
- Use at your own risk

## Not For Production

This code is intended for:
- Research and experimentation
- Educational purposes
- Architecture exploration

This code is NOT intended for:
- Production deployments
- Safety-critical applications
- Any application where incorrect outputs could cause harm
